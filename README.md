Table tennis in pure-css

- Everything is 2d, i leveraged box-shadows within animation-keyframes to give the illusion of 3d-movement. The ball for instance is just a standard html-element with radius of 50%, its the shadow that makes it appear as if it moves up and down.
- I added some extra 'dirt' on the table to make it appear more realistic.
- To make the rotationary perspetive more 'cinematic' (less static), theres one rotate-animation-keyframe attached to a container (parent of table) and another one with different timing attached to the table itself.
